# Kangaroo Point Cliffs TOPO

A free, bare-bones, easy-to-use topo for the most common sport climbing at Kangaroo Point in Brisbane, Australia. 

# File Organisation

The wall is divided into two halves, either side of the 'waterfall'. 
These are referred to throughout at 'lmw' and 'rmw'. 

Data on the routes is stored in the two `csv` files, these get rendered into a ticklist with `tables.tex`. 

The graphics of the routes are done by hand in the two `svg` files. 
Any other way would be more trouble than it's worth. 

Compile everything together with `make`. 
If you don't have the bitstream charter font Inkscape will probably render everything incorrectly. 

# Old Booklet

You may have seen an older version which was an a5 booklet. 
I prefer to just render the routes nowadays, but you can still find the booklet in `/booklet/`.
